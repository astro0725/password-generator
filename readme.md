# Password Generator Challenge
## Description
In this assignment I created a generator that follows average password guidelines.
- The primary goal for this project was to create a functional password generator that utilized alert prompts for customization
- Learning how different variables work and how I can use them in a function
- This assignment has taught me different javascript functions as well as how to properly utilize variables and different uses of them. Also taught me how alerts work and how to use variables to generate random indexed values.

## Features
- Choose how many characters you want to generate (8-128)
- Can customize what type of characters you want to include (i.e. upper and/or lower case letters, as well as numerical and special characters.) 
- Button seamlessly generates a password that you customize.
