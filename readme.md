# Password Generator Challenge
## Description
In this assignment I created a generator that follows average password guidelines.
- The primary goal for this project was to create a functional password generator that utilized alert prompts for customization
- Learning how different variables work and how I can use them in a function
- This assignment has taught me different javascript functions as well as how to properly utilize variables and different uses of them. Also taught me how alerts work and how to use variables to generate random indexed values.

## Features
- Choose how many characters you want to generate (8-128)
- Can customize what type of characters you want to include (i.e. upper and/or lower case letters, as well as numerical and special characters.) 
- Button seamlessly generates a password that you customize. 

## Usage
- Visit here: https://astro0725.github.io/password-generator/
- When you click generate password you will receive a series of prompts:
    - It will ask you to put in a numerical value for how long you want your password to be
    - Then it will ask what kind of characters you want in your password. (Any comibination is possible)
- After you complete the prompts your password will appear in the text box.
